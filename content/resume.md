### Summary

I am **passionate** about people and information and decided that becoming a developer would be an incredible way to understand the connection between and within both.
Computer \***\*technology** has become embedded into so many industries I have been a part of **education**, ecommerce or **science** research. In being able to understand how programming works I hope to be able to work in this industry in a meaningful and progressive way to help the community to access information to make better decisions about education, economic and environmental choices in their lives.
Although most of my roles have required me to work independently, they have made me very focused on delivering results and being accountable for my time. My work has required me to work as part of a team and to bring out the best in people for a good result.

I have extensive experience presenting to an extensive variety of audiences and very capably prepare and deliver effective presentations and lessons. As part of my Master’s work, I had to communicate with the wider public through various talks and public forums. My position as a lab technician at the Invetech Research and Development required dealing with a lot of software. After the completion of a series of MS Access database courses I was able to create a database driven test system. This was exported to various third parties worldwide that used the hardware system under development. I continued to utilise my computer skills in my thesis work, both in consolidating and analysing data, researching via the Internet and writing the actual thesis. I have also successfully managed a research biohazard laboratory which required sharp judgment skills in order to maintain an effective and safe working
environment. This included maintaining OH&S standards as well as ISO 9000 standards, ordering reagents and maintaining equipment.
