As a requirement for Victorian Teachers provisionally registered to teach a sequence of learning activities including collegial teaching is undertaken. I worked with a senior teacher as part of a Main lesson sequence for plant Chemistry involving Class 9 students. I set up an brew of apple cider which was later bottled. Students measured alcohol content by measuring specific gravity.<figure id="attachment\_687" aria-labelledby="figcaption\_attachment_687" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 733px">
