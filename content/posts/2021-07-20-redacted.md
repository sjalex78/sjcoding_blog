Woah this is getting a bit tricky&#8230; I wonder is it my remote teaching fatigue, having four children remote leanring at home, the wet weatehr or simply things are starting to ramp up! Today I redacted and use a .split method. But the big aaaahaaa moment was simply seeing strings and arrays and starting to get the idea of blocks&#8230;. I panic here and there about wher to put the next bit of code&#8230; today my take away you can have blocks in blocks!<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Thought I might also tackle the additional question the first being about dropcase but the others will have to wait- this beginner is flaking out with brain lockdown fatigue&#8230;&#8230;<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
