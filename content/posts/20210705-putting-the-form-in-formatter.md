  After a short break I found my flow a little bumping at the start of the unit- a great reminder that a daily practice is going be hugely benefical for my learning. Today we **chomped** our way through creating a form

{{< gist sjalex78 59c93601dbe33abd091418e4f8d5acf2>}}

> <span style="font-size: 2em;">gets take the input from the user </span>

> <span style ="font-size: 2em;">while chomp simple removes the extra line</span>


The *method* to capitilize was forced to only be applies to the variable answer rather than the variable by simply making it exciting just add a ! to the end.

Now I wonder what a ? might do ......
