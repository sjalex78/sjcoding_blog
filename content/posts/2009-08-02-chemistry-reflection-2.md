What happened/What did I do today?
Venn Diagrams, populating and creating.
Developed our context ideas.

Which of these things do I consider important?

Which resolutions, goals or learning wishes does this give rise to?
What was I thinking?
Sometimes I was verbalising before my brain was in action. I think while I talk and contribute and perhaps need to listen a little more before I interact.

What was I feeling?
I feel particularly stupid. I can not just regurgitate chemical content as others in the class do. Although this is about my journey I have noticed that when I don&#8217;t understand something with other around who communicate how well they do can make me feel stupid. This is a concern to my future students. Your self confidence can effect your learning.
