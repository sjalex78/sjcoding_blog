What happened/What did I do today?
<span style="font-style: italic;">An overview of the subject and what is to come. Why are are we here? What is it that chemistry teachers do? how is this different to other science and subject teachers.<br /></span>
What was I thinking?
<span style="font-style: italic;">Have I really got what it takes to be an exceptional chemistry teacher? I feel dread at this point? Is my PKN really every going to exist- it feels like an impossibility? I really wonder if I can do this?</span>

What was I feeling?
<span style="font-style: italic;">Confused. Shut down a little. </span>
What did I do?
<span style="font-style: italic;">I felt myself personalizing my interactions with Debbie and other students. When I did not give the correct response I imagined it was because I was not a likeable person! Woohoo back to secondary school bingo suddenly I have this perception that my learning is about being liked or not. How do I get over it and there will be student who suffer this as well. How does a teacher help them or deal with this personality dynamic?</span>

How can I use the sessions to practice the type of behaviour I want to learn?
** I need to get a grip. Learning takes time and I might struggle (just like my students) as an adult do I simply get a grip or try to look at the bigger picture. I will see how the PKN exercise help me to focus.
