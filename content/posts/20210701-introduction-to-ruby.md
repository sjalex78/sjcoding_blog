This module really helped me to my head around variables, methods, comments, strings. Below is a series of screen shots and my notes. I am writing handwritten notes when undetaking all these units- I feel writing down ideas really helps me to process new ideas and the transformation of information definately a learning strategy that has been very sucessful for me.
