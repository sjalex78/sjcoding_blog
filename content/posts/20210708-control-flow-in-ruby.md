Woah this is when my maths logic really needs to boot in. The if, else, elsif, unless can really start to get tricky when considering you combine a whole heap of operators particularly **the** and **ones**! 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong>&&</strong> aka same as
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>!! </strong>aka inclusive
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>! </strong>aka not
  </p>
  
  <cite>and operators can get a bit tricky with your logical grey matter </cite>
