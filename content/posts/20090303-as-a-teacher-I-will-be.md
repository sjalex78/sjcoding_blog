In describing what type of teacher I imagine myself to be is like holding up a mirror to voice, &#8220;the me&#8221;, inside my head. In expect that I will be an enthusiastic, empathetic, passionate, realistic, energetic and a warm teacher. These too are my core qualities which I use in life. A statement made in my first education lecture was that primary school teachers love the children, secondary school teachers love the subject and lectures love themselves. Although I love science, my true passion is people. So I will be teaching people. Being there to help pave a section of someones road through life. I expect to that as a teacher I will continue to change and develop. I see that if I was to hold the mirror up 10 years ago on my 21st birthday my story would be completely different as it will be in 10 years time when I am 41. I look forward to traveling down my own road in this new direction.
