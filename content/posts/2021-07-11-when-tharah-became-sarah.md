So today was a .downcase!, .include? and .gsub! introduction&#8230;. I am struggling with some of my odering and recalling the simple things like adding a end after an if or else. With perserverance and concentrating- (a little hard with 4 children consentantly interrupting) I managed to figure it out. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

This code basically takes an input drops it to lowercase hunts for the presence of the letter &#8220;s&#8221; and replaces any s the &#8220;th&#8221;. It is basically the reverese code of how my brothers speech therapist in the 1980&#8217;s taught hin to put his snake (aka tongue) behind its gate (aka teeth) and soon I became Sarah rather than Tharah.
