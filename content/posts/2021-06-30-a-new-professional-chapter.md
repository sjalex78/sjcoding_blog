After 10 years of being a secondary school teacher- becoming an outdoor educator, science teacher and teaching through remote schooling Melbourne 2020 I have made a big decision to try something new&#8230;.. 

<p class="has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color">
  Today my journey begins.
</p>

After signing up to do <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a>: Web Development course course starting October 2021, I am required to undertake a number of coding DIY units on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>. 

Today I started my codecademy &#8220;Welcome to codecademy&#8221;&#8230; a very short module that basically told me&#8230; fiddle around with javascript, run the code and learn via inquiry&#8230;. sounds very like my classroom. I played with letterColors, mouseResponseThreshold, friction and rotationForce. 

<p class="has-vivid-red-color has-text-color">
  Colour, bubbles and movement= success! I feel like <strong>I CAN</strong> as per the intention of the mini course. Next on my list LearnRuby&#8230;..
