### Book Review: Specification by Example
#### Chapter 1. Key benefits

So now I have made the move to tech my birthday gift list has opened up to en entire new repertoire. I received [Specification by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/specification-by-example#toc) for my 44th birthday from my husband and  as recommended from one of the senior developers who interviewed me in Febuary. Before I start my graduate position with Thoughtworks I plan to read, review and practice the ideas from this book.... so here goes Chapter 1. Key benefits! I summarized the short chapter with a short video outlining the positive outcomes for Specification by example which is broken up for four key elements:
- implementing change more efficently
- high product quality
- less rework
- better work alignment.

#### Chapter 2. Key Process Patterns
Much of this chapter is defining the key artifacts, such as "deriving scope fom goals", that are utilized to drive software development that will fulfil the business goals and objectives. It then also presents a number of examples to consolidate the links between these artifacts. A key take away is a living document created through user story tests/validation become a living document that if following a set of simple yet specific form can be transferrable and used effectively in a development environment to fulfil the business goals.
