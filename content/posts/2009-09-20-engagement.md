## Students are not here to pour information into. I wanted to engage student and I found the best way was to ask. As relationships were forged students became more comfortable with asking questions.

# **Ask them and they will tell you know what they want to know.** 

## Engagement for some might be found in a book but I want to see science in their world not just in the world of textbooks and science class.

## It isÂ  hard for a science teacher to answer some questions and I did not what to trivialise the science when answering student questions. In some circumstances using some newly acquired concept enabled students to answer their own questions.
