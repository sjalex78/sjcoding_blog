There is a complete sense of welcome at my first placement school. We started the morning with a staff meeting beginning with a song of reflection and welcome. All the staff members took part. I was then off to a year 11 home group where daily devotion also takes place. A student volunteered to take devotion and she was incredibly confident. She presented excerpts from the bible and fluently and articulated to her peer why they should give themselves totally to Jesus. She was incredibly passionate and captivated her class for 10 minutes.
