After 10 years of being a secondary school teacher- becoming an outdoor educator, science teacher and teaching through remote schooling Melbourne 2020 I have made a big decision to try something new…..

**Today my coding journey begins....**


After signing up to do [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/melbourne/web-development-course/full-time): Web Development course starting October 2021, I am required to undertake a number of coding DIY units on codecademy.

Today I started my **codecademy** “Welcome to codecademy”… a very short module that basically told me… fiddle around with javascript, run the code and learn via inquiry…. sounds very like my classroom. I played with letterColors, mouseResponseThreshold, friction and rotationForce.

Colour, bubbles and movement= success! I feel like I CAN as per the intention of the mini course. Next on my TO DO LIST LearnRuby…..
