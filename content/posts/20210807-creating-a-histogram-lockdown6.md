Today was the first day of the 6th Lockdown for Melbourne. There is some solis in learning to code in amongst the croazy homeschooling and teaching. I also have a deadline to try to get this pre learning done by the end of August. My struggle is coming down to a lack of practice and getting stuck on blocks. 

My Code today cuts up a string, creates an array and looks at the frequency of word in a given input
