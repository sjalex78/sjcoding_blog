### Student B- Prior Knowledge and Skills, Challenges in Learning

  * Student B finds learning concepts easy but does not have a strong work ethic and can be resistant to participating in a positive manner with teachers and students in class. He is outspoken and particularly rude to teachers. He does not do much work in class even when micro-managed and will only engage on his own terms. There is a competitive element to this student but social elements are his key focus.
