<span style="font-weight: bold;">What did I do today? </span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Wow what a day a complete contrast to the lat 2 weeks. I learn about water freezing I couldn&#8217;t remember why it was in a lattice form- I really can&#8217;t remember needing to think about it. I enjoyed the group effort to define the reason why water freezes the way it does. The development of kinesthetic ways to demonstrate the hexagonal formations of ice. why it has a lower density to liquid water. FUN FUN FUN. It felt like the class was style more suited to my learning style preference- visual and verbal. The creative element was exciting too I really do think chemistry is the arty science. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great for artist to understand the paint dynamics in terms of chemical concentration as well as visual strength? </span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Which resolutions, goals or learning wishes does this give rise to? </span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">I think I have finally reached a resolution about my &#8220;complex&#8221; to the know all in the class (yeap it is all in my head) It is ok to not be a walking text book I might not know the content off my heart but in relearning it and having to address my gaps I can understand what my students might feel like and try to learn a concept with my students in mind. </span>

What was I thinking?  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Very positive, feling like I have my chemistry teacher mojo back, but aware that I have a huge learning curve and continuos learning throughout my career. This surprises me- I thought do a dip ed and you are a teacher. I am starting to realise do a dip ed and have the ticket to a lifetime of professional learning. I am gald I realise this now because I feel at ease that I don;t have to have all the answers before I can teach but rather to learn the effective way to understand learning connections and the big picture and then to know how to develop this and help it grow.</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What did I do? </span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Took a second longer to answer. I tried to listen more effectively and not always ask to be first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How can I use the sessions to practice the type of behaviour I want to learn? </span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">I took longer to listen analyse and then answer and this helpee me to get more out of class. Still a little enthusiastic at times but a little more controlled today.</span>
