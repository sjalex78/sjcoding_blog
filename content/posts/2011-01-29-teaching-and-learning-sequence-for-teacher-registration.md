Below is aÂ A SEQUENCE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING which I was required to develop and analyse to complete my teacher registration.

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE CLASS GROUP</span>

**Main Lesson: Food Chemistry**

**Class 8**

**Key Concepts:**

  * The processes of changing food substances into body building food.
  * Food Substances found in nature can be transformed.
  * The human body can build itself through the transformation of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and water as either inner or outer processes.
  * Analysis of foods PLANTS, SEEDS, MILK, EGGS, SUGAR and CHOCOLATE have similar or unique components.

**Key Skills:**

  * Safety when conducting experiments
  * Research, presentation skills and poster condensing
  * Connecting micro and macro components of food chemistry ie the browning of an apple connected with enzymes

&nbsp;

**VELs Outcomes:**

  * _Science: Science knowledge and understanding_: students explain change in terms of cause and effect in experimental examples

  * Science: Science at Work: students can explain how sustainable practices have been developed and/or are applied in their local environment

&nbsp;

  * _Communication: Presenting:_ students summarise and organise ideas and information, logically and clearly in an oral presentations

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE TEACHING</span>**

**The School:** A city based Steiner school city based in transition to a senior IB program. Split facility across two campus in transaction to one. Student have a core class teacher till class 8 who will cover most subjects.

**Characteristics of students which may affect their learning:**

A mixed ability class with students who have alwaysÂ  been in Waldorf education mixed with students new to Waldorf in Class 8. Some students will have educational disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD and numeracy and literacy limitations. The majority of students at a average to above average level for their expected VELs outcomes.

**Teaching Challenges presented by the class or students**

A very talkative groups who need to be reminded to not talk while other are. Some students define chemistry as â€œexplosionâ€ and do not connect with a subtle version of chemistry. Student of class 8 undertook a major year long project with a number choosing cooking or food as a focus so have an active interest in the main lessonÂ  topic.

**Physical Learning environment:** 

The classroom for Class 8 and the utilisation of local walking paths through the Collingwood Childrenâ€™s Farm

**Other important factors to consider:**

No Laboratory available. Daily 2 hour class for 3 weeks with a science double class utilised for the main lesson.

### **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLANNING FOR THE LEARNING SEQUENCE OF WORK</span>**

Dates: November 1-19<sup>th</sup> 2010 Main lesson times 8:55am-10:45am Daily

**What student should know at the conclusion of the unit:**

  * The components which constitute food, carbohydrates, proteins, sugars.
  * How enzymes act in browning of fruits and how this can be prevented.
  * How to write and develop an experimental procedure
  * Linking the sun energy to available energy in food

**Prior knowledge and skills:**

  * Combustion carbon and heating processes
  * Anatomy of human digestion
  * Observational skills and drawing
  * Chance and Data main lesson
  * Animal Biology

**Teaching and learning activities to engage students and achieve learning aims:**

oÂ Â  Experiments:

  * Â§Â  Enzyme browning reaction
  * Â§Â  Seed Dissection
  * Â§Â  Little Miss Muffet: making curd and whey protein coagulation
  * Â§Â  Identifying the presence of starch

oÂ Â  Art:

  * Â§Â  Boarders
  * Â§Â  Drawing observations
  * Â§Â  Diagrams
  * Â§Â  Milk Image

oÂ Â  Reading and Listening:

  * Â§Â  Teach reading from text
  * Â§Â  Thinking and reasoning via verbal based questioning and discussion

oÂ Â  Maths and Analysis:

  * Â§Â  Pie chart of mammal milk comparison and comparison between species

oÂ Â  Food Diary:

  * Â§Â  Food Kilometers
  * Â§Â  Mood based on food diary

oÂ Â  Research and presentation

  * Â§Â  Poster on history and chemistry of fruit/veg
  * Â§Â  Cook with this fruit and veg
  * Â§Â  Class presentation

**Monitoring student learning and effectiveness of teaching:**

Questions at the start of each lesson to recap and summarise what was covered the day before, having students write their own procedures from an experiment conducted the previous session. Review of homework,

3 day rhythm- eg allowing students to experience an experiment day 1, develop their procedure, aims and observations in good copy day 2 and discuss the theory. Write conclusions based on discussion from day 2 on day 3. Using open questions, targeting individual students.

**Assessment Tasks:**
