This lesson was tough, with the school term starting back this week and today the start of lockdown 5.0 for Melbourne, I am somewhat tired&#8230;. but once I got my coding logical mind switched on I got the hang of creating loops. It seems Ruby has a heap of various ways to loop- I managed to create 3 infinate loops and crashed my codecademy learning site 3 times!<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped">

I am writing lots of notes in my note book as the retention of these new ideas is somewhat fleating and being able to reference my notes makes it all flow a lot better.
