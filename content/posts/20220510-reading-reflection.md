- Science hard skills
- Art the soft skills

- Practice is important.
" My point - think of consulting like salt." *1
- work in teams.."By itself, salt is of hardly any use"*1
- let the team drive the journey be there but don's do it all. "Salt is not visible, but its presence is always felt"*1
- get to the core issue and be impactful "No salt or very little salt will leave the food insipid or inedible"
- make yourself redundant put in the energy when needed but know when and were to handover, lean in, pull out let the team drive itself "Too much salt will also leave the food inedible"
- Not every battle is needing your focus be ready to adapt and change. "Salt cannot be added to everything, e.g. dessert"
