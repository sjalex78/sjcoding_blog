## BACK to RAILS Camp ~~2020~~ ~~2021~~ 2022

Finally after many covid induced stumbles 
Rails Camp ~~2020~~
 ~~2001~~
 2022 is underway, taking place at [Woodhouse Activity Centre](https://www.woodhouse.org.au) in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. the majority of participants have "escaped" from the Eastern states to attend this event for Ruby enthusiast. 

After the mandatory RAT test before registration and upon being given the all clear, participants were able to settle in to the dorm accomadation or set up a tent in the lush bush setting. There were many very happy "Hellos", this camp is obviously an opportunity to get into some coding as much as an opportunity for people to reconnect with like minded people!

Our Welcome to Country was gave a terrific overview of the Aboriginal Australian peoples lands upon which were staying of the Peramangk nation. We heard of the evidence of first Nations use and protection of the local ancient lands. 

There is a genuiene calmed, chilled nature permeated throughout the group who are very comfortable with one another. There many small groups of programmers sharing coding anecdotes over the first nights dinner and many participants headed off the to a game of Ware Wolf, while others headed off for an early night and the night owls stayed up late chatting about code and life into the early hours of the morning.

For a junior I was nervous initially, How was I going to fit?, Actually pair program and not feel like a dead weight? and What was I going to learn? Over the weekend I worked on my Sci-poster amp and was fortunate to work with some more experienced developers to sort out how tailwind, wicked pdf and Rails 7 can work together! 

So all in all a great weekend and I am looking forward to trying out Rails Camp again in the future....
