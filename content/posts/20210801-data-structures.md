After a small (lockdown induced break; I have started again now with a deadline set I am ploughing through. I am battling myself as a learner as my role as a teacher has sarted to be my undoing. I am frustrated with not completley understanding it and struggling with not having the language fluenency to help myself. I can read chemistry, biology, science, gardening, parently;. this Ruby language is new so I feel slow and clumsy. 



Today my Hash.new, .each and putting data from arrays and array of arrays was on the menu.
