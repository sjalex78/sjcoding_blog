So today was a .downcase!, .include? and .gsub! introduction. I am struggling with some of my ordering and recalling the simple things like adding a end after an if or else. With perserverance and concentrating- (a little hard with 4 children constantly interrupting) I managed to figure it out.

This code basically takes an input, drops it to lowercase, hunts for the presence of the letter **s** and replaces any **s** with **"th"**.
 It is basically the reverse code of how my brothers speech therapist in the 1980's taught him to put his snake (aka tongue) behind its gate (aka teeth). After a matter of weeks I became **Sarah** rather than **Tharah**.
