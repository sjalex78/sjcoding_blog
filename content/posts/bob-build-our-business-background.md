## So who is BOB?
  Bob stands for BUILD OUR BUSINESS and is an app designed to help businesses to find, store and share software business tools ideas. BOB is a Le Wagon Boot Camp batch #757 final project for three Le Wagon students: Sarah, Yan and Emmanual.

### The Problem
> **Target:** People looking for software to leverage to grow their businesses & complete tasks more efficiently.**Pain:** Business owners & freelancers spend precious time trying to find the right software to use to complete their next task.**Solution:** An all-in-one business software Wiki application with relevant software categorised for ease of access. ***Originality:**: Rather than scouring blog posts and review sites on search engines, they can access relevant info in one place.
