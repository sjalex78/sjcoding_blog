## So who is BOB?
 [Explore and see what BOB is all about!](https://le-bob-app.herokuapp.com/)
  Bob stands for BUILD OUR BUSINESS and is an app designed to help businesses to find, store and share software business tools ideas. BOB was developed in the last weeks of Le Wagon Boot Camp batch #757 by Le Wagon sudents: Sarah, Yan and Emmanual.

### The Problem

> **Target:** People looking for software to leverage to grow their businesses & complete tasks more efficiently.
**Pain:** Business owners & freelancers spend precious time trying to find the right software to use to complete their next task.
**Solution:** An all-in-one business software Wiki application with relevant software categorised for ease of access.
**Originality:**: Rather than scouring blog posts and review sites on search engines, they can access relevant info in one place.
