### Finding a junior position

After completing my 11 week boot camp I embarked on the daunting task of finding my first tech role. Initially I jumped onto LinkedIn, Seek and other job seeking platforms. The sea of jobs that appear up when you undertake a broad scope job search can be full on! As a career changer I have wanted to ulitilize my exisiting professional expereience while still being a junior developer. One of the first jobs I applied for was the Thoughtworks Graduate Program after many conversations with established programmers who recommend applying for larger companies who have gradutae programs.
