A quick ramble &#8230;

It&#8217;s ok to be unable to capture science for myself as content driven. It is actualy the ideas that science is constantly moving and student only get a captured moment which is stationary. Why do kids love TV because it is constantly evolving. MOVE MOVE MOVE Ao that is what I want to do. Make the connection for students that this is exciting. That is what I get excited and motivated about.

WOW

Plus having this &#8220;moment&#8221; made me realised that the teachers I loved in science were like this. I got the yr 8 science prize in year 8 Why? I wasn&#8217;t getting the best marks, I was lazy and didn&#8217;t do homework. Why because my teacher was trying to tell me that being enthusiastic and asking lots of questions and thinking beyond the textbook was ok. I am no Einstein but I had and still continue to have a scientific mind and that in inself is something to treasure, be proud of and use in my life. He also told my class that getting A&#8217;s was not what science was all about it was the questioning and analysis that mattered most.

Thanks <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr Richardson</span>, 17 years on and I have finally understood why I got that prize and I thank-you for seeing it in me, it allowed me to believe in myself and love science as a less than perfect student
