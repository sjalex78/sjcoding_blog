I have spent the last few weeks developing a Combustion main lesson for Class 7. Today was my final chance to get the chemistry lab ready for the lessons to start tomorrow. For the first week I have planned to introduce fire in a number of ways which will be in the coming days posts.

Students will be asked to develop a pamphlet which could be distributed for community education about a famous chemist and their discovery which is still used in the modern era. I have created a pamphlet as the handout. This will be their only homework set for the first two weeks.

I look forward to the next three weeks and teaching the main lesson.
