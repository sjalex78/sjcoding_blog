So if you read this title without knowing that I am learning some Ruby programming you may have started to picture me chipping away at at large red rock (ruby) to create the desired shape for my latest pendent.... well perhaps ðŸ˜‰ 

In some ways this visual could be true if the actual function of the object was not changed. In a nutshell Refactoring Ruby is basically analysing code and making changes that leaves it

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    CLEAN SIMPLE and EASY TO MAINTAIN
  </p>
</blockquote>

without effecting the function of the code!

A number of diferent ideas were introduced and then I was given an opportunity to have a go! for example:



#loop6.times{puts Melbourne in lockdown}

or 

lockdown=6
I am in lockdown+ lockdown.to.s +!!!!

#changes to 

I am in lockdown #{lockdown}!!!!
