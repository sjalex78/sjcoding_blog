### Book Review: Specification by Example
#### Chapter 1. Key benefits

So now I have made the move to tech my birthday gift list has opened up to en entire new repertoire. I received [Specification by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/specification-by-example#toc) for my 44th birthday from my husband and  as recommended from one of the senior developers who interviewed me in Febuary. Before I start my graduate position with Thoughtworks I plan to read, review and practice the ideas from this book.... so here goes Chapter 1. Key benefits! I summarized the short chapeter with a short video outlining the positive outcomes for Specification by example whihc is broken up for four key elements: 
- implementing change more efficently
- high product quality
- less rework
- better work alignment.
