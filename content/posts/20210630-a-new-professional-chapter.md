**Welcome to coding..... you can do it!!**
After 10 years of being a secondary school teacher- becoming an outdoor educator, science teacher and teaching through remote schooling Melbourne 2020 I have made a big decision to try something new.. 

  Today my journey begins.

After signing up to do [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) Web Development course course starting October 2021, I am required to undertake a number of coding DIY units on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). 

Today I started my codecademy unit..
Welcome to codecademy: a very short module that basically told me "fiddle around with javascript, run the code and learn via inquiry". Sounds very like my classroom. I played with **letterColors**, **mouseResponseThreshold**, **friction** and **rotationForce.** 


  Colour, bubbles and movement= success! I feel like **I CAN** as per the intention of the mini course. Next on my list LearnRuby..
