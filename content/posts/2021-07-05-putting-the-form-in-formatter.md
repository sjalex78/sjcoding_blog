<div class="wp-block-cover has-background-dim">
  <img loading="lazy" width="959" height="622" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-1172" alt="" src="https://sarahjalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-7.27.02-pm.png" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="https://sarahjalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-7.27.02-pm.png 959w, https://sarahjalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-7.27.02-pm-300x195.png 300w, https://sarahjalexander.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-05-at-7.27.02-pm-768x498.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" />
  
  <div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
    <p class="has-large-font-size">
      gets take the input from the user while chomp simple removes the extra line&#8230;..
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
