I feel teaching is a wonderful way to connect with people across a wide spectrum of ages and cultural backgrounds. Education is a wonderful frontier for effecting change and helping people to learn to be curious and question the choices they are presented throughout their life. Mucha of my teaching experience has been with teens who are transitioning from childhood and adulthood when curiosity needs to be nurtured and the flame of independence fanned. Below are some blog entries of different units of work that I hope other educators can utilise for inspiration to encourage their students to be lifelong learners.
