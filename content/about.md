After a huge 2020 2021 in Melbourne a fresh and new perspective about my professional life has emerged. This has prompted a professional journey  direction change resulting in me having enrolled to complete a full stack coding bootcamp...

I hope that blogging about my coding development will give fresh insights about how a professional educator learns a new language and transfers the knowledge of learning principals from a students perspective.
