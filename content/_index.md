I am a post pandemic Melbourne based career changer moving from science education in the world of technology. After a year as a graduate developer with [Thoughtworks](www.thoughtworks.com), I have now moved into a role with [Fat Zebra](www.fatzebra.com) as a junior React developer and am learning something new every day!

Checkout my Blog, Portfolio, Science and Teaching Pages to learn about my coding development and how a professional educator learns a new language and transfers the knowledge of learning principals into a meaningful and inspiring career in tech.
